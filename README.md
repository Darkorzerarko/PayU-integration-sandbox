# This is my attempt to integrate PayU sandbox ==(WIP)==

(unfortunately it won't work on github pages as it doesn't support/host APIs, so don't look at the deployed page ;))

## At the moment it works on locally hosted server.

The code fetches an `Access Token` for future use in payment integrations after a button is pressed (only this at the moment)
